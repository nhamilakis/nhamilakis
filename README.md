# 👋 Hello World! I'm a Research Engineer @ LSCP

## 🧪 What I Do

By day, I make computers do science stuff at the [Cognitive Machine Learning Team](https://cognitive-ml.fr). By night, I still make computers do science stuff, but with more coffee ☕ or i sleep sometimes.

### 🐍 My Daily Dragons
- **Python**: My trusty companion for taming or creating problems and wrestling with data
- **SLURM**: Managing clusters like a boss (technically, like a job scheduler)
- **Linux**: Yes, I use arch btw... (just kidding, or am I? 🤔)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack 

```python
my_stack = {
    "languages": ["Python", "C/C++", "Bash", "rust"],
    "interests": ["Typing", "Clean Code", "Cleaner Code", "Parallelization" "System Administration"],
    "superpower": "Turning coffee into code",
    "current_status": "Parallelizing everything that moves"
}
```

## 🎯 Current Missions

- [ ] Finally migrate from ZSH to Fish (been on the TODO list since the dawn of time)
- [ ] Master Rust without getting too rusty
- [ ] Remember what I did with my Ocaml/Scala knowledge
- [ ] Write documentation that future me won't hate
- [ ] Achieve perfect Python type hints (a scientist can dream...)

## 🎨 Fun Facts

- I have a love-hate relationship with parallel computing
- I speak fluent Python, some C++, and can curse in binary
- Still trying to figure out if P = NP (aren't we all?)

If you want to talk about code, or debate whether tabs are better than spaces (they're not), feel free to reach out!

*Warning: May spontaneously start talking about type hints and parallel computing optimization*
